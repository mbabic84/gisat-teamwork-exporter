Prepare: npm i

Run: node index.mjs <apiKey> [number of month 1-12] [year]

You can get your apiKey here: TeamWork -> User -> Edit my details -> Api & Mobile

Code will export totals of logged times for previous month (by default, can be specified). It will print results to console formated as JSON and save it to file as well.
